# onprom

The [**onprom**](https://onprom.inf.unibz.it) is an event log extraction tool suite using ontology-based data access (OBDA). It is developed under [KAOS: knowledge-Aware Operational Support](http://kaos.inf.unibz.it) project to support the various phases of the OBDA-based event log extraction framework. It consists of various plug-ins of the [ProM](http://www.promtools.org) extensible process mining framework and a stand-alone toolkit.

## Modules

This project consists of the following modules:

- **onprom-data**: common data classes for modules
- **onprom-umleditor**: UML editor for ontology design and OWL 2 QL export
- **onprom-annoeditor**: Default annotation editor for annotating ontology with event-data annotations derived from XES event ontology 
- **onprom-dynamiceditor**: Dynamic Annotation editor for annotating domain ontologies with annotations derived from custom event ontologies
- **onprom-logextractor**: Log extraction module using mappings, ontology and annotation queries
- **onprom-obdamapper**: OBDA system mapper
- **onprom-plugin**: ProM plugins
- **onprom-toolkit**: stand-alone toolkit, which provides user interface to use all toolchain
- **onprom-maven**: local maven repository for dependencies that are not available in central maven repository

### We rely on state-of-the-art [ontop](http://ontop.inf.unibz.it/) system for the OBDA. [Ontop](http://ontop.inf.unibz.it/) is a platform to query relational databases as Virtual RDF Graphs using SPARQL. It is fast and packed with features. It implements the query rewriting and unfolding algorithms together with an extensive set of optimization techniques. Please visit [ontop](http://ontop.inf.unibz.it/) page for more information.
