# onprom

The [onprom](https://onprom.inf.unibz.it) is an event log extraction tool suite using ontology-based data access (
OBDA). It is developed under [KAOS: knowledge-Aware Operational Support](http://kaos.inf.unibz.it) project to support
the various phases of the OBDA-based event log extraction framework.

## Modules

This project consists of the following modules:

- [data](./data): common data classes for modules
- [umleditor](./umleditor): UML editor for ontology design and OWL 2 QL export
- [annoeditor](./annotationeditor): Annotation editor for annotating ontology with annotations based on different upper
  ontologies
- [obdamapper](./obdamapper): OBDA system mapper
- [logextractor](./logextractor): Log extraction module using mappings, ontology and annotation queries
- [toolkit](./toolkit): stand-alone toolkit, which provides user interface to use all toolchain
- [plugin](./plugin): ProM plugins (_currently doesn't work well and not supported_)
- [ocel](./ocel): Java implementation for [OCEL standard](http://www.ocel-standard.org)
- [example](./example): XES example in conference submission system domain
- [demo](./demo): OCEL example in ERP domain

## [ontop](http://ontop.inf.unibz.it/)

We rely on state-of-the-art [ontop](http://ontop.inf.unibz.it/) system for the OBDA. [Ontop](http://ontop.inf.unibz.it/)
is a platform to query relational databases as Virtual RDF Graphs using SPARQL. It is fast and packed with features. It
implements the query rewriting and unfolding algorithms together with an extensive set of optimization techniques.
